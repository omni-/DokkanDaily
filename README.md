# DokkanDaily
Wordle-esque daily challenge for DBZ: Dokkan Battle.


TODO:
* Add image upload for sharing and viewing clears
	- OCR for verification, high scores, etc?
* Formalize daily reset
	- Number of clears posted?
* UI improvements
	- Fit screen better
	- smoother/smaller images
	- Bottom bar with links
* Logging infra
* Admin dashboard
* Login

IDEAS:
* Unit DB tool?
* Another type of daily dokkan challenge? (guess the unit?)
